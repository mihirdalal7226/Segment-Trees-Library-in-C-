# Segment-Trees-Library-in-C-

This project consists of a General Purpose Segment Tree library in C++ and can be used in Competitive Programming Contests. We need to include the header file in our code and we can make a Segment Tree Data Structure of 4 types:

1) For answering Range sum query: sumsegtree <<<typename>>> var_name(size, array);
2) For answering Range minimum query: minsegtree <<<typename>>> var_name(size, array);
3) For answering Range maximum query: maxsegtree <<<typename>>> var_name(size, array);
4) For answering Range gcd query: gcdsegtree <<<"int">> var_name(size, array);
  
The range updates are also included with the help of Lazy propagation.
